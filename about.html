<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi there! I'm a trans Vietnamese-American game dev. My focuses are in tool development and shader programming. Currently most of my projects have been 2D focused in Unity, but I'm looking to branch out into 3D games and Unreal! Outside of gamedev, I enjoy cosplaying and writing. You might see me at a SoCal convention someday!</p>

<p>Currently I'm studying at UC Riverside, looking for jobs and helping build the community at <a href="https://gamespawn.github.io/">Gamespawn</a>.</p>
