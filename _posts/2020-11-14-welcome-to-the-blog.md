I'll be posting blog posts every month or so about what I've been learning. 

It'll probably come in the form of tutorials covering a specific thing I implemented, or about gamedev stuff I want to show off to the world.

Next up, I'm currently looking at either making a point-and-click tutorial for Unity or explorations into VFX/shaders.
